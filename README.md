# WhereAmI (Forge)

WhereAmI is a lightweight Mod that allows players to
check which structure they are currently inside or which structures exist nearby.

The mod is designed to be simple, fast, and fully compatible with modpacks,
including packs that add custom structures.

## Features

- Detect the structure you are currently inside using accurate bounding box checks
- Scan nearby chunks for surrounding structures
- Supports both vanilla and modded structures
- Server-side only (clients do not need the mod installed)
- Lightweight and performance-friendly

## Commands

### `/whereami here`
Detects the structure the player is currently inside.

### `/whereami scan <radius>`
Scans surrounding chunks within the given chunk radius for nearby structures.
